# HTML Introduction #

Bits of description on the way the web works and how the book is structured.
# HTML chapter 1 #

HTML is all about the structure of the page, elements are used to define the structure and meaning of sections of the document.
# HTML chapter 8 #
Are HTML versions really a thing anymore? Just using <! DOCTYPE html> should be good enough for modern browsers shouldn't it?

The `id` attribute identifies one element on a page.

The `class` attribute identifies  multiple elements of the same type.

# HTML chapter 17 #

New elements to describe the content of pages better, you're still going to have a bowl of div soup occationally.

When a book says older browsers they mean Internet Explorer. There are workarounds you can use to make them work but how relevant is that today?

# HTML chapter 18 #
 Visitor questions:
 * WHo is going to be looking at the site?

* What will they be looking for
* Will they come back?

Plan the structure with a site map.

Use wireframes to figure out where things should go.

It's all about communicating information. Grouping similar items and changing sizes and colors of elements help visitors see what is important.

# JS Introduction #
JavaScript is used to make pages more fun and useful.


# JS Chapter 1 #

Scripts are step by step instructions to tell the computer to do something.

 Computers are not smart, they only do what you tell them to. 
 
 Plan your script before writing any code. 

 Objects are models of real world things.

The document object is the computer's model of the page.

 Javascript should be kept in its own files.
