# Images

If you are using an image that needs to be resized, use css to resize it rather than using the `height=""` and `width=""` attributes of the `<img>` tag.

You can use images as backgrounds for elements.

You can use image sprites to have one image file and move the position so different parts of the image are seen under different conditions.

# Practical information

Search Engine Optimization means 'Make your site readable by Google's robot' if Google's robot thinks your page is worthy it will include it in search results.

You have to have your site hosted somewhere, you want to have a domain name that is easy to remember and represents your site(good luck, all the good ones are already taken).
