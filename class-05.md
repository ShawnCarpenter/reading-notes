# Images
Pictures add visual interes to the page. to insert an image you use the `<img>` tag.
You specify the location of the image with the `src ` attribute. Be considerate of people who use screen readers and use the `alt` attribute to describe the images you use.
The soource can be local or on another server.

Rules:

1. Use the right format.
1. Save pictures at the size they will be displayed on screen.
1. ...in pixels.

## Formats
JPEG is most commonly used for photographs.

Gif is used mostly for animations, logos, and to start arguments about pronounciation. (It's obviously pronounced gif not gif)

Png is used for logos and line art. Also for webcomics.

## Size matters

save pictures at the expected display size. If you resize pictures by specifying the size in code the picture will not look as good as it would if it was resized using real image editing software.

## Measure in pixels.

Don't size pictures based on physical dimensions because screens have different numbers of pixels per inch so it can be unpredictable.

### Cropping
Not a whole lot to say about this other than I found the example pictures amusing. Don't try to make a giraffe fit in an elephant shaped frame.

## Vector images

Vector images are stored as a collection of shapes instead of pixels, they can be resized without loss of quality but are suited more for line art and logos instead of photographs.


# Color

Use color, it makes things look better. Be careful to choose text and backgrooound colors that have enough contrast to be read easily.

colors can be specified using by using different notations.
1. Name: `Steelblue`
1. RGB: `rgb(70, 130, 180)`
1. Hex: `#4682b4`
1. HSL: `hsl(195, 100%, 50%)`


# Text

You can use different fonts if they are on the user's computer or downloadable from a location on the internet.

You can specify the size, weight, spacing, and style of a font.

You can control alignment and spacing.

You can use pseudo classes to change properties of the text under certain conditions.
