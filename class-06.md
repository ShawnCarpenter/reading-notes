# Object literals

Objects are collections of properties grouped together.
You can create objects by using object literal notation. 

```js
const myObject = {
    name: 'thing1,
    color: 'blue'
} 
```

Objects are useful to model real world things, they can store properties `color: 'blue', ` and also functions `setColor: function(newColor)  { this.color = newColor };`
You access object properties using either dot or bracket notation.

# The  DOM of Doom

The Document Object Model is a representation of a wep page. You can use it to access and manipulate the elements on the page.

you can select either a specific element or a collection called a nodelist.
Node lists are objects that represent one or more elements on the page.

Different browsers deal with DOM elements differently so :
# Don't use IE, Seriously, even Microsoft wants you to stop, just don't do it!!!!

You can use a good browser to inspect the DOM.
