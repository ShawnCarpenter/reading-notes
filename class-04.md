# HTML Links and Layout: #
## Links ##

Links are what makes the WWW interesting. They allow you to move from the page you are looking at to a page somewhere else.

Links are created with the `<a>` element. They connect to the location specified in the `href=""` attribute.
Links can point to:

- A location on the same page:`href="#id-of-the-element"`
- A different page on the same site `href="directory/page.html`
- A different site entirely `href=http://www.othersite.com`
- an email address `href="mailto:email@domain.com"`

## Layout ##

Layout is just arranging boxes. (When I say just arranging boxes, I mean it's all arranging boxes, not that it's simple.)

Reading over this has made me appreciate the flex and grid features in modern css.

Functions are black boxes you give input and that provide output.

Objects are boxes that hold  properties. The properties can be data or functions.
